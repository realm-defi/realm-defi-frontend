# Realm Frontend Interface

This is front-end repository of the [basis.cash](https://basis.cash/).

## üíª Set Up Environment

To begin, you need to install dependencies with Yarn.

```
 $ yarn
```

You should update **default provider URL** because our production provider URL is limited by CORS for security.
On `src/config.ts`, please replace it:

```diff
- defaultProvider: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/OLD_PROVIDER_URL',
+ defaultProvider: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROVIDER_URL',
```

After it, you can launch the development server with following command.

```
 $ yarn start
```

## üë©‚Äçüåæ If You Want to Bring Your Own Contract...

If you want to use different contract deployment on development,
please build [realm-frontend](https://github.com/realm-defi/realm-defi-frontend) and copy-n-paste 
the deployment information generated on `build/deployment.<network>.json` into this project's deployment directory,
which is `src/realm-defi-frontend/deployments`.

Then, you need to change the deployment reference into yours. Suppose that the new deployment file is named `deployments.local.json`:

```diff
- deployments: require('./realm-defi-fronted/deployments/deployments.mainnet.json'),
+ deployments: require('./realm-defi-frontend/deployments/deployments.local.json'),
```
